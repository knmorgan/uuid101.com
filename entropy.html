                    All UUIDs are 128 bits, but they have varying amounts of entropy. For
                    example, a version 1 UUID has a 60-bit timestamp and a 48-bit node ID, but
                    it cannot be said to have 108 bits of entropy. First, the node ID only has
                    47 bits of entropy rather than 48, due to the multicast bit on MAC addresses
                    and the fixed bit on random node IDs. And the timestamp is using an epoch
                    date in the 16th century, and can address dates into the 53rd century, which
                    is not going to happen in practice. Over any given century, the timestamp
                    used in a version 1 UUID can be said to have ~55 bits of entropy. And
                    likewise, it has ~48 bits of entropy over any given decade. When used over
                    the course of a century, a version 1 UUID would have approximately 102 bits
                    of entropy in total.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Version 4 UUIDs are simpler. In general, six total bits are consumed by the
                    version and variant markers, leaving 122 bits of entropy. This means that,
                    over a century, roughly one million times as many version 4 UUIDs can be
                    expressed than version 1 UUIDs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, despite this, version 1 UUIDs should guarantee uniqueness by their
                    nature of specifying a point in time and space, assuming they're using a MAC
                    address rather than a randomly-generated node ID. There is a chance of
                    collision among version 4 UUIDs, although it is negligibly small.
